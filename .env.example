# Optional: YouTube Data API v3 key for "Learn with Purpose" playlist.
# Enable YouTube Data API v3 in Google Cloud. The playlist is loaded at build time only (key is never in the built site).
# If your API key is HTTP-referrer restricted, add these to the key's referrer list in Google Cloud Console:
#   - http://localhost:* and http://127.0.0.1:* (local dev)
#   - https://attilahajdu.github.io/* (GitHub Pages)
#   - https://ktca.netlify.app/* (Netlify)
# PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=

# Optional: Origin sent with the build-time API request so referrer-restricted keys work. Set in Netlify env to your Netlify URL (e.g. https://ktca.netlify.app). GitHub Actions sets this in the workflow.
